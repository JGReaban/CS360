# CS360

Specifically this contains the code for my Project 3, was was supposed to be an inventory app where
users could log in and see the iventory of a database, presumably a store or some such, complete with
item information, how many, and so forth. Different users would have different access levels and some could
add new items or change quantities. 

Unfortunately, it took me ages to just figure out how to have multiple fragment, and to have buttons work on those
fragments. So that's basically all I got. I did attempt to write java for the databases, but as I have had zero experience with
SQLite (I do know MongoDB pretty well) they are more theoretical than anything, since I didn't have time to try to get them working

As we had a pretty strict deadline (essentially two weeks), my normal coding approach was thrown out the window and when I got real
sick during the second week, I pretty much did the best I could in the time I had. Which wasn't much

Normally I would do an iterative design, start with the basics, the slowly flesh it out. That is what I attemped here, but I never
really got beyond the basics, due to the deadline. The testing and other stages were never reached, as the project never
really did much except switch fragments.
